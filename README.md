# Node.js Express MongoDB Starter

This is a starter template for a Node.js Express application with MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB installed and running

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abiola814/phone-and-email-contact-logs.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-express-mongodb-starter
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and set your environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

2. Test the API using tools like [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26542987/2s9Yynkj5T).
